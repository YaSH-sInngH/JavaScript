### Objects
---

Objects in JavaScript are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript.

#### <u>Object</u>
- In JavaScript, an object is a collection of related data and functions, known as properties and methods, respectively. 
- Properties are “key: value” pairs that store data, while methods are functions associated with the object that can manipulate its properties.

> Note:- Object()  can be called with or without new. Both create a new object.

Objects can be created in two ways, by using literals or by using constructor.
